# Weather App 

We implement an app with basic weather functionality with a location input, this project is the first where we will be using an API to fetch data and display on the interface, as seen of most applications/websites.

## Concepts learn prior to working on this project.

1. Callback hell and it's implications ( how tracing of code becomes difficult and control is left to external handlers rather than us)
2. Promises, and how it reduces the pain points of Callbacks.
3. Async/await, and the event loop and how async await makes asynchronous code look similar to what is present in a synchronous code.
4. Event loop, main thread, micro tasks and how async code runs in the event loop.
5. The fetch API, how requests were made before fetch came along. What goes in a request and how to consume an API.
6. Public APIs and how to use them, and what limitations are kept on users using certain methods.


# This is Work in Progress
